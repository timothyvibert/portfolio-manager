"""Portfolio exposure aggregation — where an account is economically exposed now.

The first rung of the risk-analytics views (risk blueprint §3/§8.1). It answers
"where is this book exposed *right now*" by aggregating the **Bloomberg snapshot
greeks the load path already computed** (``AccountState.greeks.by_position`` —
delta/gamma/vega/theta straight off the option snapshot) into account-level dollar
exposure, beta-adjusts it to a single SPX benchmark, and rolls it up
position → structure → account. It is the *current-state* lens: it reads the live
greeks, it does **not** re-price anything (the pricing engine is for the hypothetical
states of the scenario rung).

Pure and read-only — no Dash, no Bloomberg, no pricing-engine import. It reads only
already-loaded state and is duck-typed so tests pass lightweight stand-ins.

What it produces (every number carries a trace of its inputs):
- **Net dollar greeks** — Δ/Γ/V/Θ for the account.
- **Dollar beta (net market exposure)** — Σ(position dollar-delta × the name's SPX
  beta). Computed under both the adjusted and raw beta so the panel can show both;
  ``beta_source`` selects which is the headline (adjusted by default — the stable,
  desk-matching number).
- **Market value vs economic exposure** — the book's mark vs its delta-equivalent
  underlying exposure, side by side (an option's premium understates its direction).
- **Vega by tenor bucket** — vega's term structure, on its own finer buckets.
- **Position → structure → account rollup** — each structure's exposure, the
  unstructured residual, and the account total, conserved: structured + unstructured
  == account. The split rides the shared allocation ledger
  (``reconcile_allocations``), so contended legs count once and rejected structures
  drop out.
