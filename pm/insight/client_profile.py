"""Per-account client behavioural profile from the trade history.

A read-only summary of *how an account trades* — strategy posture, direction,
tenor, sector lean, sizing, cadence — derived purely from the account's own
trade rows plus the already-loaded underlying snapshot. It is computed once in
the load path (mirroring the exposure / scenario passes) and stored on
``AccountState.client_profile``; the UI later only reads it. No Bloomberg, no
recompute.

Design boundary — only the *robust flow tier* lives here. Every dimension is
derivable from a single self-describing trade row (its lifecycle action,
instrument, quantity, principal, date), so it survives a trade window that is
shallower than the positions' tenor. Dimensions that need opening/closing trades
to be paired (holding period, roll behaviour, realised income) are deliberately
absent — they belong to a later, separately-gated pass and are not declared here.

Strategy posture is read from the trade flow alone (what the account *opens*).
It never claims a short call is "covered" or "naked": that is a property of the
holdings at the time of the trade, which the flow does not carry, so conflating
it with the current structure list would assert facts the data does not contain.

The load-bearing piece is the lifecycle normalisation: ``option_lifecycle_action``
arrives as a raw string with no enumerated vocabulary, and a wrong mapping is
invisible and poisons every downstream count. So the canonical set is explicit,
``buy_sell`` is cross-checked against it, cancelled rows are dropped, and any
string outside the canonical set fails loud rather than being silently bucketed.
