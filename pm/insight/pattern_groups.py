"""Alert taxonomy: pattern_id -> group.

A presentation/filter lookup that lets the morning blotter slice alerts by the
kind of action they imply. Deliberately NOT stamped onto the ``Fire`` dataclass
and not part of fire creation — it is a contained lookup the blotter row-builder
(and future features) import.

Covers the full live pattern inventory P1-P20: the per-position / account
patterns P1-P15 (``patterns.PATTERN_META``) and the structure fires P16-P20
(``structure_fires._META``). ``test_pattern_groups`` asserts this stays exact.
