"""Structure-aware management fires — the alerts the recognised structures unlock.

Runs UPSTREAM in the load path, after structure detection. Reads the already-built
positions, the BBG underlying snapshot (spot), the per-contract option mark from
holdings, an assumed short rate, and an as-of date — the same inputs the engine and
P7 already consume — and appends ``Fire`` objects to each ``AccountState``. The UI
reads them; nothing recomputes downstream.

Only desk-grade triggers fire. Each fire carries structure context. The carry input
is source-aware: a live treasury-curve rate is stated plainly, a fallback scalar rate
is flagged as estimated. Contested mechanical conventions (the 21-DTE window, "50% of
max profit", "75–85% of width") are deliberately NOT triggers here — they belong on a
card as context only.
