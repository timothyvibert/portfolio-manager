"""The per-pattern headline-metric map (item 11) — data + types only.

For each engine pattern (P1-P15) this names the **single metric whose movement defines
"materially changed"**: where the value already lives in the fire's ``trace``, the
``PatternConfig`` threshold it is measured against, and the direction that fires. It is
the static artifact the *next* item (material-change re-surfacing) consumes to decide
whether a suppressed alert's condition has moved enough to bring it back — by comparing
the suppression's captured baseline trace against the current fire's trace at this key.

**This item defines the map; it builds no comparison.** Nothing here reads a suppression
or compares captured-vs-current — that is deliberately deferred.

Each entry carries a ``metric_type`` describing how the next item should compare it:

* ``monotonic_numeric`` — one number that crosses the threshold one way (P1, P6, P9,
  P10, P12, P15). The clean case: compare the headline value against the threshold.
* ``event_recurrence`` — the real trigger is a calendar event, not a drifting metric
  (P4 a fresh UBS note, P7 the ex-div date, P14 the earnings countdown). Re-surfacing
  is better keyed to the event recurring than to the numeric drifting.
* ``multi_axis`` — two or more conditions, or a categorical gate (P2, P3, P5, P11, P13).
  The primary axis is the economic spine; the secondaries are recorded so the
  comparison can decide whether one axis suffices.
* ``proxy_only`` — no clean single metric; the trigger is event/structure-shaped (P8 a
  roll-timing asymmetry). The primary is the best available numeric proxy, flagged.

``trace_key`` is a path into ``fire.trace`` (e.g. ``("result", "captured_pct")`` or
``("inputs", "spot_vs_200d_ma", "value")``). ``threshold_field`` is a ``PatternConfig``
attribute, or ``None`` where the gate is a computed/event condition with no single dial.
The test suite asserts every ``trace_key`` resolves on a real fire and every
``threshold_field`` is a real ``PatternConfig`` field, so the map cannot silently drift
from the detectors.
