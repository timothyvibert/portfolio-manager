"""Tier-count summary for an account's alerts.

The standalone Actionables table was merged into the Positions grid (its fires
now live in that grid's Alerts column, reachable via the shared modal). What
remains here is the pure tier-count summary used by the KPI strip and the
Positions section header — ``tier_counts`` and ``summary_line``.
