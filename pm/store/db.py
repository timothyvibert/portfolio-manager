"""The local SQLite app store — one connection seam for all persistent state.

A single database file under the data dir, gitignored exactly like the JSON it
replaces, never committed. It is the on-disk *application* store and is named
distinctly from ``portfolio_state.py`` / the in-memory ``PortfolioState`` (which is
transient, rebuilt on every load) so the two are never confused: this file holds the
state that must survive a reload.

Today it persists structure confirm/reject resolutions. It is deliberately shaped so
the next persistent features slot in behind this same seam — a new table plus a thin
sibling store module reusing :func:`connection`, with no reshaping here:

* alert suppressions / dismissals (lifecycle on a fired alert),
* editable thresholds and preferences (settings),
* dated holdings/signal snapshots for day-over-day diffs.

Those tables are designed-for but intentionally *not* created yet — see the schema
notes below.

``sqlite3`` is in the Python standard library, so this adds no dependency.
