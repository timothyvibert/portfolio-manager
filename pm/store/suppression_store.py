"""Local persistence for per-alert suppress / snooze decisions (item 9).

A suppression silences a *specific* alert — keyed ``(account, name, pattern_id)``
where ``name == fire.underlying`` — either permanently (``suppressed_until`` is
NULL) or until a date (a snooze). It is **selective by design**: suppressing P12
(concentration) on XLK in one account silences only P12 on XLK there; every other
pattern on XLK, and P12 on other names, still fires.

This is the first feature that *writes* user state through the SQLite seam
(``pm/store/db.py``). It mirrors ``structure_store``'s shape — thin I/O over
``db.connection()`` plus an ``apply_suppressions`` pass — and adds no dependency.

**No-recompute contract.** ``apply_suppressions`` runs in the load path *after* the
engine has produced fires. It only *marks* a fire (sets ``Fire.suppression``); it
never removes the fire from ``acc.fires`` and never re-derives anything. So a restore
(or a snooze that has expired) plus the next apply clears the mark and the alert
returns — the fire object was there all along. The active surfaces (blotter
consolidation, deep-dive rows) filter on :func:`is_active`; the modal's Muted footer
and the Alert Manager read the *muted* fires to display and restore them.

Snooze expiry is **lazy treat-as-inactive**: a row whose ``suppressed_until`` is
before ``as_of`` is simply absent from the active set (so the alert fires again), but
the row is retained — auditable, no background cleanup job. ``created_at`` drives the
Alert Manager's "days active" staleness cue.
