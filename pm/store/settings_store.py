"""Local persistence for editable alert thresholds (item 11).

A setting is one threshold override — keyed ``(scope, name)`` where ``scope`` is
``"global"`` for v1 (the column is kept so a future per-account scope slots in without
reshaping) and ``name`` is a ``PatternConfig`` field. The stored ``value`` is the
JSON-encoded override in PatternConfig-native units; defaults that have never been
overridden are simply absent (defaults-over-overrides).

This is the second feature to *write* user state through the SQLite seam
(``pm/store/db.py``), after suppressions. It mirrors ``suppression_store`` /
``structure_store``'s shape — thin I/O over ``db.connection()`` plus a small build
helper — and adds no dependency.

**Reload, not recompute.** Unlike a suppression (which only *marks* an already-computed
fire), changing a threshold changes *which fires the engine produces*, so it cannot be
applied by re-marking — it requires re-running the engine. The apply path is therefore a
deliberate persist-then-reload (write the override here, then reload state through the
existing refresh path), which is why this store exposes only persistence +
``build_pattern_config``; the engine read happens in ``load_portfolio_state``.

**Validation lives in the catalog.** Every value is coerced/clamped through
``threshold_catalog`` before it is persisted and again when it is read into a config, so
a bad or stale value can never reach the detectors. An override for an unknown/renamed
field is ignored, not fatal.
