"""Per-underlying signal computation for portfolio review.

Each signal function takes a single-row pandas Series (from the underlying
snapshot DataFrame) and returns a Signal record or None. The orchestrator
runs every signal against every underlying and returns a per-ticker dict
of signal lists.

Signal thresholds use institutional conventions documented in
``SIGNAL_DEFINITIONS`` — these are the bands a sales/trading desk would
use when discussing a position without context-specific historical
percentiles. The thresholds are intentionally simple universal bands;
per-name calibration (vol percentiles, sector-relative trend, etc.) lands
in later prompts when historical data fetches are added.
